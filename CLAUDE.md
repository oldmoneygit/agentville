## Behavioral guidelines

<!-- aia-harness:behavioral — non-negotiable; do not edit, reorder, or remove during enrichment -->

1. **Think before coding** — state assumptions explicitly; if multiple interpretations exist, present them instead of picking silently; say so when a simpler approach exists; if something is unclear, stop and ask.
2. **Simplicity first** — minimum code that solves the problem. No speculative features, no abstractions for single-use code, no unrequested configurability, no error handling for impossible scenarios. If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite.
3. **Surgical changes** — touch only what the request requires; match existing style; don't refactor, reformat, or "improve" adjacent code. Remove orphans _your_ change created; leave pre-existing dead code alone (mention it, don't delete it). Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.
4. **Goal-driven execution** — turn tasks into verifiable goals ("fix the bug" → "write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"). For multi-step work, state a brief plan with a verify check per step, then loop until verified.
5. **Main session = orchestrator — it does not implement.** Plan, decide, coordinate; ALL delegable implementation and analysis goes to a specialist subagent via `Agent`, parallel when scopes don't conflict.

## Stack

TypeScript, JavaScript · npm

Architecture: **layered**.

## Canonical commands

Always use these exact commands (do not guess):

- **Install:** `npm install`
- **Lint:** `npm run lint`
- **Format:** `npm run format`
- **Typecheck:** `npx tsc --noEmit`
- **Test:** `npm run test`
- **Build:** `npm run build`

## Releasing

New extension version / release / `.vsix` — "gerar nova versão da extensão", "nova
release", "empacotar/build/ship the extension" — use the **`release-vsix`** skill
(`.claude/skills/release-vsix/`): patch bump + minified build + `.vscodeignore`/bundle-size
guard + install reminder. Don't hand-run `npm run package` for a release; the skill also
verifies nothing extraneous (the harness `.claude/`, vault, `graphify-out/`…) ships.

## Workflow & Agents

Invoke `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` for **non-trivial** implementation — trigger it when the request meets **≥2** of:

- touches **3+ files** or **2+ domains/layers** (UI + agent, API + DB…)
- is a **new feature / epic / cross-cutting refactor** (not a one-line or single-function change)
- needs a **multi-step plan** or ordered tasks, each with its own verification
- has **unclear scope or root cause** and needs exploration before coding

Skip it — implement inline — for typo/copy fixes, single-function edits, config tweaks, or one-file bugs with an obvious cause.

When dispatching subagents, you MUST use the matching specialist agent from the table below — never the generic agent when a specialist is listed. Cross-reference the task type with the "When to use" column and pass the exact name as `subagent_type`.

Model dispatch: an agent's frontmatter `model` wins; a generic dispatch or a project/user agent with no `model` in frontmatter is force-set to `sonnet` by a PreToolUse hook, so it never silently inherits this session's model — except namespaced plugin agents (`plugin:name`), left unrewritten since their frontmatter isn't reliably hook-resolvable. Pass `model` explicitly yourself for those, or to override for complex work: `haiku` for search/exploration, `sonnet` for implementation, `opus` for architectural judgment — cheapest tier that fits.

### Superpowers → Project Specialists (mandatory bridging)

<!-- aia-harness:agent-routing — superpowers→specialist bridge; do not remove -->

Superpowers skills (`superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents`, `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`,
`superpowers:executing-plans`, `superpowers:systematic-debugging`) show `general-purpose` as the default
`subagent_type` in their examples. **Never dispatch `general-purpose` (or a generic
implementer) when a specialist below covers the domain** — pass the specialist's exact
name as `subagent_type` instead.

> Basis: superpowers itself states "User's explicit instructions (CLAUDE.md) — highest
> priority." This section applies that priority over the agent types its examples suggest.
> The normal flow is unchanged (`superpowers:brainstorming` → `superpowers:writing-plans` → `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`);
> only the dispatched `subagent_type` changes.

## Architecture map

Single-tree VS Code extension. Pipeline: scan log files → parse JSONL → detect
subagents → dedupe/nest → render tree. All source under `src/`:

- **extension.ts** — VS Code entrypoint: `activate`/`deactivate`, registers the tree
  view + 5 commands, gates monitoring on the `agentville.enabled` setting,
  delays the first scan ~10s so it doesn't race Claude Code for the log files.
- **sessionTreeDataProvider.ts** — orchestrator + `TreeDataProvider`: owns the session
  Map, file watchers, 15s refresh timer, `lsof` active-status detection (macOS/Linux
  only), and calls dedupe + background-agent nesting before feeding the tree.
- **sessionScanner.ts** — discovers Claude (`~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`) and
  Antigravity (`~/.gemini/.../transcript.jsonl`) log files. Pure, never throws.
- **logParser.ts** — incremental JSONL parser (caches a per-file byte offset, reads
  only appended bytes); builds a `Session`, delegates title, subagent and project-path
  extraction.
- **projectPathResolver.ts** — works out which project a transcript belongs to: Claude
  Code's `cwd` (preferred) or its ambiguous, POSIX-shaped encoded directory name (raw
  name on Windows until `cwd` self-corrects it), Antigravity's prose metadata /
  tool-call `Cwd`, else walks up for a project marker.
- **sessionActivity.ts** — decides whether a session is still running (`lsof` on
  macOS/Linux only, recent write, user turn awaiting a reply, thinking-only last turn,
  or live subagents).
- **subagentDetector.ts** — detects subagent start/stop from a log entry across both
  Claude and Antigravity shapes, incl. async-launch ACK vs real `<task-notification>`.
  Three Claude launch shapes, only one of which is a `tool_use`: classic `Agent` tool,
  `<forked-skill-launch>` on a `type:"system"` entry (`context: fork` skills like
  `/code-review`), and in-process teammates (grandchildren — deliberately not detected).
  See `.claude/memory/architecture-subagent-dispatch-mechanisms.md`.
- **sidecarReader.ts** — reads the `agent-<id>.meta.json` sidecars from both candidate
  directories (the transcript's own and the one `projectPath` encodes to — they differ
  inside a worktree), dedupes across them, and caches by filename set so a refresh that
  changed nothing re-parses nothing.
- **subagentMetadata.ts** — fills a detected subagent's real name/model from the sidecar,
  joined on `toolUseId`. Runs on parse (`logParser`).
- **nestedSubagents.ts** — attaches grandchildren (subagents launched by a subagent) via
  the sidecar's `parentAgentId`, one level deep, with a best-effort mtime status. Runs on
  the refresh tick, NOT on parse: a background subagent writes only two lines to the
  parent transcript, so parse-driven refresh would go stale exactly while it works.
- **nameExtractor.ts** — derives the session title from the first real user prompt,
  skipping slash-command scaffolding and `isMeta` turns.
- **sessionDedupe.ts** — pure dedupe key, stable relevance ranking,
  background-agent → launcher matching, `applyNestedAgentLiveness` (promotes a launcher to
  'working' when its matched nested agent still is, since `computeSessionStatus` only sees
  same-file subagents), and `upsertIfMoreRelevant` (the collision-safe map insert
  `sessionTreeDataProvider` uses instead of a raw `Map.set`, so a same-id stub left by
  Claude Code's native worktree-entry can never overwrite the real session).
- **treeItems.ts** — the `vscode.TreeItem` subclasses (Brand/Session/SubAgentGroup/
  SubAgent/Message) + model-badge and relative-time formatting.
- **subagentTreeChildren.ts** — pure builders for the subagent and nested-subagent
  (grandchild) tree levels, extracted from `sessionTreeDataProvider`.
- **types.ts** — the `Session` and `SubAgent` domain shapes.
- **logger.ts** — best-effort debug append to a local file; never throws.

## Conventions

- **Parsing/scanning never throws** — wrap every `fs`/`JSON.parse` in try/catch that
  logs via `logDebug` and returns an empty/fallback value; a bad log line must never
  break the tree.
- **Keep `vscode` out of the parsing core** — `logParser`, `subagentDetector`,
  `nameExtractor`, `sessionDedupe`, `sessionScanner`, `projectPathResolver`, `sessionActivity`
  import no `vscode` and are
  unit-tested in `src/test/`; only `extension.ts`, `sessionTreeDataProvider.ts`,
  `treeItems.ts`, `subagentTreeChildren.ts` touch the VS Code API.
- **Parse incrementally** — `LogParser` caches a per-file byte offset and reads only
  appended bytes; never re-read a whole transcript on refresh.
- **Dedupe/ranking stays deterministic and stable** (`isMoreRelevant`) so the tree
  never oscillates between refreshes — don't replace it with naive "newest wins".
- **Comment every log-format quirk** (async-launch ACK vs real completion, sidechain
  phantoms, ambiguous project-dir decoding) — these encode observed transcript reality;
  preserve them when editing parsers/detectors.
- **Support both brands** — Claude Code and Antigravity — behind `type`-branched
  detection; new log-shape handling must cover or explicitly no-op the other brand.
- **User-facing strings are English** (view messages, `package.json` config
  descriptions); code, identifiers, comments and documentation are English too.

## Engineering rules

<!-- aia-harness:fixed — non-negotiable; do not edit, reorder, or remove during enrichment -->

- Match the style of surrounding code; do not introduce new patterns unprompted.
- Test what can break — business rules, branching logic, money/security/auth, bug regressions; skip trivial getters, wrappers, config, presentational UI (rubric: `.claude/rules/05-testing.md`).
- Run the lint + test commands above before claiming work is complete.
- Never commit secrets; keep them in gitignored env files (`.env`/`.env.local`) — `.claude/settings.local.json` is only for MCP-server credentials referenced by `.mcp.json`.
- Fix every compilation/syntax/lint error found during a session — regardless of whether you edited the file. Never leave the build broken or label errors "pre-existing, not related".
- When performing a code review (user requests it or a workflow triggers it), always use `code-reviewer` and `security-reviewer` and `typescript-reviewer`, applying the `uncle-bob-craft` skill's criteria (Dependency Rule, SOLID in context, code smells) alongside their findings.

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Rules:

- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
- Investigating code (file search, implementations, call sites, "where is X"): alongside graphify, dispatch specialist subagents (`model: haiku`) in parallel — never one at a time, never generic-only. Cuts investigation time.

## obsidian-vault

- **obsidian-vault** (`.claude/rules/obsidian.md`) - this project's long-term memory at `vault-obsidian/`, MCP-only access via `mcp__obsidian__*` tools, never direct file access.

Before answering anything that touches a past decision, a failed approach, or a convention spanning modules, or when resuming work from an earlier session, call `mcp__obsidian__search_notes_tool` first. See `.claude/rules/obsidian.md` for the full trigger table, write-tool traps, and access rules.
