/**
 * UserPromptSubmit orientation hook for the project's Obsidian vault. When
 * `.vault-obsidian/` exists as a directory, injects a short instruction
 * telling the model when to search it (via the obsidian MCP server) before
 * answering. No regex classification of the prompt — the model judges when
 * the instruction applies, the same "let the model decide" approach as
 * `graphify-orient.mjs`. Pure context injection: emits `additionalContext`
 * only, never a permission decision, so it never blocks a session.
 *
 * Inert (exit 0, no output) when `<projectRoot>/.vault-obsidian` does not
 * exist as a directory — same gate shape as `graphify-orient.mjs`'s
 * graph.json presence check. A plain file named `.vault-obsidian` (not a
 * directory) is also treated as absent.
 *
 * Cross-platform: plain Node (no shell), wired exec-form (`node <path>`) in
 * .claude/settings.json under UserPromptSubmit, no matcher (fires on every
 * prompt).
 *
 * Fails open on any I/O or parse error, including literal `null` on stdin
 * (exit 0, no output) — a vault hook must never block a session.
