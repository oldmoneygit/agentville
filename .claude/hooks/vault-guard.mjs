/**
 * PreToolUse guard for the project's Obsidian vault. Denies any Read, Grep,
 * Glob, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, or NotebookEdit whose tool input references a
 * path under `.vault-obsidian/`, and any Bash command whose command string
 * contains a `.vault-obsidian/` segment — names the obsidian MCP tool to use
 * instead.
 *
 * Direct filesystem access bypasses the obsidian MCP server's template
 * enforcement, `strict` wikilink validation, and kebab slug normalization —
 * a hand-written note silently violates all three and only fails later, at
 * some unrelated write. `Write`/`Edit`/`MultiEdit`/`NotebookEdit` are guarded
 * alongside the read tools: writing a note by hand is strictly more damaging
 * than reading one, and for the structured-path tools it is the same code
 * path.
 *
 * Two distinct checks, two distinct guarantees:
 *
 * 1. Structured path fields — a HARD boundary. Every candidate path field
 *    present on the tool input (`file_path`, `path`, `pattern`, `glob`,
 *    `notebook_path`) is checked for a real `.vault-obsidian/` directory
 *    segment — not a loose substring, so e.g. `docs/about-vault-obsidian-setup.md`
 *    is left alone. `glob` is Grep's own file filter (e.g.
 *    `--glob ".vault-obsidian/**"`) — distinct from `path` (the dir Grep/Glob
 *    search under) and from `pattern` (Grep's search regex, not path-shaped
 *    at all, vs. Glob's own search pattern, which is). Without `glob` in
 *    this list, `{pattern:"secret", path:".", glob:".vault-obsidian/**"}`
 *    slips past every other candidate while still searching the vault.
 *    Backslash separators (Windows) are normalized to `/` before matching.
 *    For these tools there is no field-level escape hatch — any tool that
 *    carries one of these field names on its `tool_input` is caught as long
 *    as it is also listed in the settings.json matcher.
 *
 * 2. Bash `command` string — BEST EFFORT ONLY, not a security boundary. Bash
 *    has no structured path field: the vault path, if present at all, is
 *    embedded inside an arbitrary shell command string. This is a plain
 *    substring check (`.vault-obsidian/` anywhere in the command), which
 *    catches the accidental/casual case (`cat >> .vault-obsidian/x.md`,
 *    `sed -i ... .vault-obsidian/y.md`) but does NOT stop a determined
 *    bypass: variable indirection (`f=.vault-obsidian; cat >> "$f/x"`),
 *    base64/encoding, or `cd .vault-obsidian && cat >> x.md` all slip past a
 *    string match. See .claude/rules/obsidian.md for the documented ceiling.
 *
 * When no candidate path and no Bash command touches the vault — the
 * overwhelmingly common case, every Read in every session hits this hook —
 * it emits nothing at all.
 *
 * Exempt: `process.env.CLAUDE_INVOKED_BY` set. `.claude/scripts/session-log-runner.mjs`
 * and `.claude/scripts/compile-runner.mjs` set this on the Agent SDK
 * sub-sessions they spawn to legitimately read/write the vault (session
 * logging, daily -> 03-knowledge/ promotion); those calls must never be
 * denied.
 *
 * No escape hatch BY FIELD NAME: for the structured-path tools, with this
 * wired, editing the vault by hand from a Claude session through one of
 * those tools is impossible — that is the intent. A human editing the vault
 * in Obsidian itself is unaffected (hooks only see Claude Code tool calls).
 * The shell command-string check does not carry the same guarantee (see
 * point 2 above). If a genuine need for direct access ever appears, unwire
 * the hook rather than adding a config flag.
 *
 * Wire in .claude/settings.json under PreToolUse with matcher
 * "Read|Grep|Glob|Write|Edit|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit|Bash|PowerShell". Fails open on any
 * I/O or parse error, including literal `null` on stdin (exit 0, no output)
 * — a vault hook must never block a session on its own plumbing failure.
