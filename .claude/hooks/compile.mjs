/**
 * SessionStart hook — vault knowledge compiler. Thin gate + detached spawn:
 * this hook does no LLM work itself. It cheaply decides whether yesterday's
 * daily note is new or changed since the last successful compile, then
 * spawns compile-runner.mjs (a detached worker under .claude/scripts/, NOT a
 * hook — no stdin event, no stdout contract, no schema) to promote anything
 * durable from it into the right PARA folder (01-projects/02-areas/
 * 03-knowledge/04-resources) out of band, after this hook has already
 * exited. Runs at the *next* session's start so yesterday's daily note is
 * guaranteed complete before it is read.
 *
 * This hook never emits hookSpecificOutput — stdout is exactly "" on every
 * path, always.
 *
 * Gates, in order (any failure -> exit 0, no spawn):
 *   1. CLAUDE_INVOKED_BY set -> anti-recursion. The runner sets this on its
 *      spawned sub-session's env; without this guard, that sub-session's own
 *      SessionStart would re-enter this very pipeline.
 *   2. stdin invalid / non-object / literal null -> exit 0.
 *   3. <projectRoot>/.vault-obsidian/daily/<yesterday>.md does not exist ->
 *      exit 0. <yesterday> is local-time YYYY-MM-DD, computed as
 *      Date.now() - 86_400_000 — never today's still-open daily note.
 *   4. <projectRoot>/.mcp.json missing/unparseable/no mcpServers.obsidian ->
 *      exit 0 (the runner cannot work without that server block).
 *   5. idempotency: sha256 of the daily file's current bytes (first 16 hex
 *      chars) already recorded for this filename in
 *      <projectRoot>/.claude/hooks/log/compile-state.json -> exit 0. That
 *      state file is deliberately a project-level, CROSS-session cache —
 *      not sessionScratchDir — because its whole purpose is to survive
 *      across sessions and stop an unchanged daily note from being
 *      recompiled every time a new session starts. It is written only on
 *      success, and only by the runner (never by this hook), so a failed
 *      run retries next session.
 *   6. spawn compile-runner.mjs detached, passing the daily note's absolute
 *      path, its filename, and the project dir as argv; env carries
 *      CLAUDE_INVOKED_BY.
 *   7. exit 0, no stdout.
 *
 * Fails open on every I/O / parse / spawn error — a vault hook must never
 * block a session from starting.
